# FM7 - A Polyphonic Synthesizer for Norns With 6 Operator Frequency Modulation

Plug in a MIDI controller or a Monome grid and off you go. All 32 algorithms from the DX7 have been implemented. Check parameters menu for all the things you can change.

## Future plans

* Envelope editing via UI
* Add LFOs

## TODO

* Envelopes respond to MIDI velocity
* Update GUI to correcetly display the DX7 algo drawings
* Default amplitude mix might be a bit high
